        <h1>CS 109A/STAT 121A: Predicting Movie Success</h1>
        <h2>Motivation</h2>
        <p class="Motivation">It is notoriously difficult to predict the success of a film. From summer blockbusters that make hundreds of millions of dollars to flops that fail to recuperate more than a small percentage of the money spent on production, the performance of movies varies wildly. We aim to create a model to predict box office revenue based on various predictors from genre to the number of faces in a movie poster. During this process, we hope to gain some insight into the factors that most influence a movie’s success.</p>
        <p>The data we used is from a <a href = "https://www.kaggle.com/deepmatrix/imdb-5000-movie-dataset">Kaggle</a> dataset. The information for 5043 movies was scrapped from the IMDb website, spanning across 100 years in 66 countries. The 28 variables are as follows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Movie Title</li>
            <li>Color vs Black and White</li>
            <li>Number of Critics who Reviewed the Movie</li>
            <li>Duration</li>
            <li>Number of Critics who Reviewed the Movie</li>
            <li>Number of Facebook likes for Movie*</li>
            <li>Duration</li>
            <li>Director’s Name</li>
            <li>Number of Facebook Likes for Director*</li>
            <li>First Actor’s Name</li>
            <li>Number of Facebook Likes for First Actor*</li>
            <li>Second Actor’s Name</li>
            <li>Number of Facebook Likes for Second Actor*</li>
            <li>Third Actor’s Name</li>
            <li>Number of Facebook Likes for Third Actor*</li>
            <li>Gross Revenue</li>
            <li>List of Genres</li>
            <li>Number of Users who Voted on the Movie</li>
            <li>Number of Total Facebook Likes for Cast*</li>
            <li>Number of Faces in Movie Poster</li>
            <li>List of Plot Keywords</li>
            <li>IMDb Link for Movie</li>
            <li>Number of Users who Reviewed the Movie</li>
            <li>Language</li>
            <li>Country</li>
            <li>Content Rating</li>
            <li>Budget</li>
            <li>Title Year</li>
            <li>IMDb Score</li>
            <li>Aspect Ratio</li>
        </ul>
        <p>*As seen above, the Kaggle dataset includes multiple variables pulled from Facebook. These
            variables may prove to be important for the analysis for more recent movies. However, the
            Facebook data will be irrelevant for movies that were produced prior to Facebook’s inception.</p>
        <h2>Data Exploration</h2>
        <p class = "data"> </p>
        <p>Figure 1 provides us with an interesting summary of how a film’s gross revenue varies with
            IMDb score. A film’s IMDb score is essentially a measure of its public critical reception. Intuition
            would suggest that films that are more well received by the public by having a higher IMDB
            score would gross more revenue as more people will want to see those films. In general, our
            plot shows that this trend is certainly present. However, there are plenty of highly rated films
            that do not make much money.</p>
        <p>The correlation coefficient between IMDb Score and Gross Revenue is 0.215, showing that
            the two are not very correlated. We decided to use Gross Revenue as our response variable
            because of how we interpreted the initial question. A different framing would have used IMDb
            scores as the y variable, resulting in a different final model.</p>
        <h2>Cleaning The Data</h2>
        <p class = "cleaning"> </p>
        <p>Initially, when we encoded the dataset for categorical variables, the dataset contained over 20,000
            predictors. Initial models took a really long time to run, and the models were overfitting on many
            training datasets. We felt that the information provided by the plot keywords variable was more simply
            encoded in the genre variable, so we dropped the keywords from the dataset. This brought our dataset
            down to 13,000 variables.</p>
        <p>Additionally, we dropped approximately 800 rows from our dataset because these rows did not
            contain information for the response variable, Gross Revenue, and we did not want to arbitrarily impute
            this data.</p>
        <p>Finally, we imputed missing data using the median of each column. As most of our data is
            categorical in nature, this was a wise decision. For example, the median for a column indicating the
            presence of an actor in a movie is likely to be 0 as said actor will be in less movies than not. Then, the
            assumption that said actor is not in a movie for which we do not have this information is likely correct.
            For numerical data, this strategy mitigates the effect extreme data would have on the mean.</p>
        <h2>Final Model</h2>
        <p class = "final"></p>
        <p>We initially investigated four different types of models - linear regression, lasso regression, ridge
            regression, and regression trees. Fitting models on our unreduced dataset took a long time, and
            results varied greatly, as seen below.</p>
        <p>Clearly, we had to reduce dimensionality. We concluded that 20 components were appropriate to
            use for Principal Component Analysis.</p>
        <p>Then, we fit many models using the different model types discussed above. As shown below,
            regression trees provided a slightly higher mean with less variability, while standard linear regression
            and its regularized counterparts gave indistinguishable results.</p>
        <p>We proceeded with regression trees, finding that R2 value testing data was maximized at a
            depth of 6.</p>
        <p>Thus, we arrived at our final model – a regression tree with a depth of 6. This model gave an
            R2 value of 0.72 for the full dataset and a value of 0.57 on testing data.</p>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p class = "conclusion"></p>
        <p>The biggest challenge in building a model based on our dataset was handling the sheer size of
            the data. Dimensionality reduction was a necessity, as running models on the full dataset was
            slow and ineffective. PCA proved to be a valuable resource here, and robust regression trees
            provided us with a model that did a fairly good job at predicting box office success.</p>
        <p>Using a basic linear regression model, we found the following factors to have the largest effect
            on revenue:</p>
        <p>As you can see, most of these factors are just movie titles. This makes sense as movie titles
            are unique, so if a particular movie has high revenue, this unique title is likely to be given a lot of
            weight. To gain further insight, we removed the title data and performed the same analysis.</p>
        <p>Interestingly, actor names are very influential here, with Korean actors particularly emphasized.
            The uniqueness discussed above likely plays a similar role here.</p>
